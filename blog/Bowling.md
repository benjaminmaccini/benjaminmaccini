## Bowling With Bumpers

**... or how outcome based productivity helps stop me from procrastinating on my editor config**

I have written about my [developer setup](../SETUP.md), which for the most part has stabilized 
in the last year or so. However, I still fall into the trap of trying to micro-optimize my editor. 
Can I work with better keybindings? Am I missing out on some life-changing code actions?
Is my `.vimrc` truly beautiful and minimalist? All these questions drag me into a productiveless
procrastination cycle. Some days I spend more time chasing marginal gains in my "productivity" than
the hypothetical gains will ever return back to me.

A conclusion I have come to recently, that has really helped me curb this urge has been the idea 
of "bowling with bumpers." To me, this means two things:

1. Make my environment condusive to making mistakes such that I can have lighter workflows with the same
success.
2. Help me let go of hubris in my craft, reap the benefits I get from the rails and enjoy programming.

#### A Good Environment Is Good

Bowling with bumpers is used as a teaching mechanism for kids who can't generate enough force to get
the ball down the lane. They are guards for the bowler so that they can have reliable and predictable
outcomes. For the programmer, bowling with bumpers means making use of **good automated dev tooling**.

I find that when it comes to producing reliable work quickly (especially within an organization), the 
usage of dev tooling massively outweighs the benefits that a honed personal setup has. Pre-commit
hooks, CI/CD(!!!), formatters, vulnerability scanners, linters, type checkers, test frameworks can all
trigger in some automated fashion that helps to standardize and improve the quality of the code. My editor
doesn't need to do any of that. It needs to write text in a decent enough way so that it is legible to me
before I push a changeset and allow me to navigate a complex codebase easily. The rest of the process I can
let the bumpers do and end up with great results.

These bumpers also do an excellent job at standardizing code in an organization. As a lead engineer, the most
important focus is maximizing other developers' output. GitOps (or whatever this year's buzzword for this is)
has been the single biggest organizational gains I have ever seen. It allows my developers to have enough 
flexibility in their local environments where they can use the tools they like, while preventing individual
choices from screwing over others' workflows.

#### Pride Is The Devil

Bumpers are also meant to provide a fun experience in an objectively difficult activity. It's for kids, right?
However, if I can bowl a 200 with the bumpers, is it still a 200? If you've ever cried in a bowling alley at a 
family reunion because you're tiny little arms can't make the ball go where you fucking want it to and you are 
too prideful to use the bumpers (oddly specific, but we're rolling with it), then you know exactly the answer.

Pride is a huge motivator for me to enhance my craft. I want to be that programmer who when they screen share 
their editor, the viewer either has no-idea what is going on or is so mystified by my ability to bounce between
files and quickly edit code that they fall silent. I also want the work I do, the product _and_ the
action itself, to be so undoubtedly perfect that there is no room for questioning from my coworkers or superiors
on my life choices. It's perfectionism, it's pride and I thought that it made me a better programmer.

However, when it comes my craft as a programmer, I am frequently working in the context greater than the code 
itself. Code is a means to an end. I need to deliver a feature by next week? It doesn't matter for shit what 
editor I use, the underlying workflows or the type of LSP I have installed. What matters is delivery with reliablity.
I have to let go of pride to do that. I need to put up my bumpers. Bowling with bumpers means letting go of perfectionism
in your craft and **focusing on the results**.

Here is a quote I really like.

#### Closing Remarks

Of course, I will always install the next new editor I hear about. I'll spend time rewarding my anxious brain with
small productivity enhancements and won't work efficiently all of the time. But going forward, I will also focus 
on parts of my workflow that buy me flexibility and comfort without perpetuating the need to be perfect. I'll learn
to bowl with bumpers and have a bit more fun with it.
