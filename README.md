### Ben Maccini

Howdy, I'm Ben, a Texan and a programmer with experience in startups, early-stage product development, algorithms
and machine learning. I have spent time in the restaurant industry, local food systems and in retail.
Food and food-related technologies are my passion.

I'm not very active online, but occasionally I write things [here](blog/) and on [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=benjaminmaccini). I also frequently spend time honing my [developer setup](SETUP.md).

I am open for new opportunities, you can find my [resume here](resume.pdf).
