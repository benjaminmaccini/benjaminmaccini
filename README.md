### Ben Maccini

Howdy, I'm Ben. I am a developer with experience in startups, early-stage product development, algorithms
and machine learning. I like food and food-related technology.

I'm not very active online, but occasionally I write things [here](blog/) and on [Hackernews](https://news.ycombinator.com/threads?id=benjaminmaccini)

I am open for new opportunities, you can find my [resume here](resume.pdf).
